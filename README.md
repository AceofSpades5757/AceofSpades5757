I thoroughly enjoy Python and Vim.

I like to create a lot of Vim plugins, particulary with Python. Also enjoy making any and all kinds of scripts to ease the daily grind, and minimize it's effects.

Always working on a lot of different projects as my interest vary greatly. Really enjoy learning new things and discussing all sorts of different technologies.
